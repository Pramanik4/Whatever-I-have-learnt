**Normal Distribution**
> Normal Distribution is known as Guassian Distribution or The bell curve. This Distribution is the most common distribution.
> It has only 1 mode.
> It's mean and median are same.
> It's sysmetric in nature because it decreases the same amount from the left and the right side.

**Subtle difference -> minor difference**

**Interpolation**
> Interpolation refer to prdicting values that are inside of a range of data points.

**Extrapolation**
> Extrapolation refer to predicting values that are outside of a range of  data poits.

> Imagine you got the number sequence:- 2,4,_,8,10,12. What is the number in the blank spot? obviously 6 .By solving this problem you interpolated the value. Now in the sequence of 2,4,6,8,10. what is the next value? 12 right? Well, in this case you have extrapolated the value.
